1. suck less


2. write a build process that, on save does:

  if we save kurth.py

    kills the currently running kurth server, if one exists
        - run the kk function in the .zshrc file
    run a new server with a terminal connected
        - need a test server that can operate locally

    otherwise just save file and continue on


3. write bash.py, which will operate as the shell. This will take in each line
   received from the server and parse it. Needs to handle pipes, redirects,
   commands, and forking.


4. write the rest of the commands that the shell, bash.py, can use.


5. write a server that a remote client (or web or cli) can connect to


6. write a front end that a client can run


7. write other types of honeypots - ftp, smtp, telnet, and anything else


8. document?
